        Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
        A guy like you should wear a warning
        It's dangerous, I'm falling

        There's no escape, I can't wait
        I need a hit, baby, give me it
        You're dangerous, I'm loving it

        Too high, can't come down
        Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
        Do you feel me now?

        With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
        You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
        With a taste of a poison paradise
        I'm addicted to you
        Don't you know that you're toxic?
        And I love what you do
        Don't you know that you're toxic?

        It's getting late to give you up
        I took a sip from my devil's cup
        Slowly, it's taking over me

        Too high, can't come down
        It's in the air and it's all around
        Can you feel me now?

        With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
        You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
        With a taste of a poison paradise
        I'm addicted to you
        Don't you know that you're toxic?
        And I love what you do
        Don't you know that you're toxic?
        Don't you know that you're toxic?

        Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
        You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
        With a taste of a poison paradise
        I'm addicted to you
        Don't you know that you're toxic?

        With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
        You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)
        With a taste of a poison paradise
        I'm addicted to you
        Don't you know that you're toxic?

        Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
        I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
        Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
        I think I'm ready now
